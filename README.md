# Meet Sergeant Majure
This was a project just for fun! My team at work was reviewing the book, Extreme Ownership, which was written by a couple of Navy Seal officers. The book applied many of the lessons learned in warfare to the business world. Each person on the team took a chapter and prepared some material to present to the team. 

When it was my turn to present a chapter, I took the opportunity to write a little Javascript application in which my alter ego, Sergeant Majure, drilled the team with questions from the chapter and generally tried to make them feel like dirt. It was fun.

The app displays a spin wheel with my team members' names on it. The Sarge spins the wheel and immediately dresses down the lucky winner. He next asks a question from the book chapter and gives points for correct answers.

I made the sergeant moody, so most of the time a correct answer was worth 1 point, but sometimes it was worth more (or less).j

## Object Oriented Javascript

This was really an opportunity for me to improve my Javascript skills. I had recently completed the Udacity Object-oriented Javascript course, so I applied what I had learned to make the sarge a well written toy.
